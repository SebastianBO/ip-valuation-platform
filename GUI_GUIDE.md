This data powers the valuation calculations.

### Yearly Cash Flow Breakdown

See exactly how value is calculated:

| Year | Revenue | Royalty Savings | Discount Factor | Present Value |
|------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1    | $201B   | $858M           | 1.095           | $784M         |
| 2    | $201B   | $856M           | 1.199           | $714M         |
| ...  | ...     | ...             | ...             | ...           |

### Technology Factor Explained

For high-quality patents, the system adjusts royalty rates based on:

- **Innovation Score** (30% weight)
  - How novel is the invention?
  - 0-100% scale

- **Commercial Score** (35% weight)
  - How successful in market?
  - Revenue impact

- **Legal Strength** (25% weight)
  - Patent portfolio quality
  - Litigation history

- **Remaining Life** (10% weight)
  - Years until expiration
  - 20-year max for patents

**Formula:**
```
Tech Factor = (Innovation×0.3) + (Commercial×0.35) + (Legal×0.25) + (Life×0.1)
Adjusted Royalty = Base Royalty × (1 + Tech Factor)
```

**Example:**
- Base Royalty: 5%
- Tech Factor: 0.869 (86.9%)
- Adjusted Royalty: 5% × 1.869 = 9.345%

Result: Higher-quality patents get higher valuations!

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. Choose Companies with Clear Segments

**Good candidates:**
- Tech companies with multiple products (Apple, Microsoft, Google)
- Consumer brands with product lines (Nike, P&G)
- Pharmaceutical with drug portfolios
- Automotive with vehicle segments

**Less ideal:**
- Single-product companies
- Private companies (no public data)
- Companies with no segment disclosure

### 2. Validate Assumptions

The auto-discovered values are **estimates**. For critical decisions:

- **Attribution %:** Conduct customer surveys
- **Royalty Rates:** Research comparable licenses
- **Discount Rate:** Use company-specific WACC

### 3. Use Sensitivity Analysis

Adjust assumptions in sidebar to see impact:
- Test WACC from 8% to 12%
- Try different attribution percentages
- Vary terminal growth rates

This gives you a **range** rather than a single point estimate.

### 4. Compare to Market Data

Validate results against:
- Comparable company valuations
- Recent M&A transactions
- Licensing deal announcements
- Patent sale prices

- Verify API key is valid
- Ensure company has segment disclosure

### "No segments found"
- Some companies don't report detailed segments
- Try a different company
- Check if company is publicly traded

### Valuations seem too high/low
- Adjust WACC (discount rate) in sidebar
- Check attribution percentages are reasonable
- Verify royalty rates match industry standards

### App won't start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run app
streamlit run app.py

# If port is busy
