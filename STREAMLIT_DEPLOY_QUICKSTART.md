## Troubleshooting

### "App is in an error state"
- Check the logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Common issue: Missing `requirements.txt`
- Solution: Make sure all dependencies are listed

### "ModuleNotFoundError"
- Add the missing module to `requirements.txt`
- Push to GitHub
- Streamlit will auto-redeploy

### "API key not working"
- Check Secrets in Streamlit Cloud settings
- Make sure format is exact:
  ```toml
  FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
  ```
- No extra spaces or quotes

### App is slow
- Free tier has limited resources
- Consider caching with `@st.cache_data`
- Upgrade to paid tier for more resources

---

## Next Level: Analytics

```python
import streamlit as st

# Add at the top
if 'page_views' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.page_views = 0
st.session_state.page_views += 1

# Show in sidebar
st.sidebar.metric("Page Views (This Session)", st.session_state.page_views)
```

## Alternative: If You REALLY Want Vercel...

Honestly, **don't do this**. It's way more work.

But if you must:

1. **Rebuild in Next.js** - Frontend in React
2. **Create API routes** - Python backend separate
3. **Deploy backend** elsewhere (Railway, Render)
4. **Deploy frontend** on Vercel
5. **Connect** the two

**Time:** 3-5 days
**vs. Streamlit Cloud:** 5 minutes

**Just use Streamlit Cloud!** 😊
