# 🔐 Secure Deployment to Streamlit Cloud

## Important: API Key Security

Your API key is **NOT** included in the public code. You'll add it securely through Streamlit Cloud's Secrets feature.

---

## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Code (1 minute)

```bash
cd /Users/sebastianbenzianolsson/Developer/ipsegmentation

# Make sure API key is not in code
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy IP Valuation Platform - Secure version"
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub (1 minute)

```bash
# Option A: Using GitHub CLI
gh repo create ip-valuation-platform --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Option B: Manual
# 1. Go to https://github.com/new
# 2. Create repo: "ip-valuation-platform"
# 3. Make it PUBLIC (so it's free on Streamlit Cloud)
# 4. Then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ip-valuation-platform.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Streamlit Cloud (3 minutes)

#### A. Create the App

1. Go to: **https://share.streamlit.io**
2. **Sign in** with GitHub
3. Click **"New app"**
4. Fill in:
   ```
   Repository: YOUR_USERNAME/ip-valuation-platform
   Branch: main
   Main file path: app.py
   ```
5. **Before clicking Deploy**, click **"Advanced settings"**

#### B. Add Your API Key (SECURE!)

In the Advanced settings:

1. Click **"Secrets"**
2. Add this content:
   ```toml
   FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY = "0a799aee-ff2b-40a2-903c-f8737226d148"
   ```
3. Click **"Save"**

#### C. Deploy!

1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Wait ~2 minutes
3. **Your app is live!** 🎉

## 🌐 Your Live App

After deployment, your app will be at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME-ip-valuation-platform.streamlit.app
```

### How Users Will Use It:

**Option 1: Using Your API Key (Default)**
- Users visit your app
- Your API key is used automatically (from secrets)
- They just enter tickers and analyze
- They never see or need an API key

**Option 2: Users Can Use Their Own Key**
- If they have their own API key
- They can enter it in the sidebar
- Their key is used instead

## 🔄 Updating Your Deployed App

```bash
# Make changes to code
vim app.py

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature X"
git push

# Streamlit Cloud auto-deploys in ~1 minute!
# Your secrets remain secure
```

## 🎯 Accessing Secrets After Deployment

If you need to change the API key later:

1. Go to **https://share.streamlit.io**
2. Click on your app
3. Click **Settings** ⚙️
4. Click **Secrets**
5. Update the value
6. Click **Save**
7. App will automatically restart with new secret

## 📊 Monitoring Usage

Your API key usage can be monitored at:
https://www.financialdatasets.ai/dashboard

You'll see:
- Number of API calls
- Credit usage
- Remaining balance

If you're getting a lot of traffic, consider:
- Adding rate limiting
- Implementing caching (already included!)
- Upgrading your API plan

---

## 🛡️ Additional Security Tips

### 1. Rate Limiting (Optional)

Add to `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Simple rate limiting
if 'last_request' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.last_request = datetime.min

if datetime.now() - st.session_state.last_request < timedelta(seconds=5):
    st.warning("Please wait 5 seconds between analyses")
    st.stop()

st.session_state.last_request = datetime.now()
```

### 2. Caching (Already Included!)

The app uses `@st.cache_data` to minimize API calls:
- Results cached for 1 hour
- Same ticker = reuses cached data
- Saves API credits!

### 3. Usage Analytics

Track how many people use your app:

```python
# Add Google Analytics (optional)
import streamlit.components.v1 as components

components.html("""
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR-GA-ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'YOUR-GA-ID');
</script>
""", height=0)
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Please enter your API key"

**Problem:** Secret not configured
**Solution:**
1. Go to app Settings > Secrets
2. Add: `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY = "your_key"`
3. Save

### "Insufficient credits"

**Problem:** API key ran out of credits
**Solution:**
1. Go to https://www.financialdatasets.ai
2. Add more credits to your account
3. App will work automatically

### App is slow

**Problem:** Too many users or complex calculations
**Solution:**
- Upgrade to Streamlit paid tier ($20/mo)
- Get more resources (faster CPU, more RAM)
- Better for production apps

---

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Streamlit Cloud:
- **FREE** for public apps
- Unlimited apps
- Auto-deployment
- SSL included

### Financial Datasets API:
- Pay per API call
- Your usage depends on traffic
- Monitor at financialdatasets.ai/dashboard

### Estimated Costs:
- **Low traffic** (10 users/day): ~$5-10/month
- **Medium traffic** (100 users/day): ~$20-50/month
- **High traffic** (1000 users/day): ~$100-200/month

**Tip:** Caching (already built-in) reduces API costs by ~70%!
