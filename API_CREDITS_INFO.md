# API Credits Issue & Solutions

## 🔴 Current Status

Your Financial Datasets API key has **insufficient credits** ($0.02 remaining).

This is why QCOM (Qualcomm) analysis failed with the error:
```
❌ Could not fetch segment data for QCOM
```

## ✅ Solutions

### Option 1: Add More Credits to Your API (Recommended for Production)

1. **Go to:** https://www.financialdatasets.ai
2. **Log in** to your account
3. **Navigate to** Billing/Credits section
4. **Add credits** to your API key

**Pricing:**
- API credits are typically very affordable
- You pay per request
- Bulk discounts available
- Check their pricing page for current rates

**Once you add credits, you can:**
- Analyze ANY public company
- Get real-time financial data
- Access historical data (5-10 years)
- Use all features without limitations

### Option 2: Use Demo Mode (FREE - Available Now!)

I've just added **Demo Mode** to the app!

**Demo mode includes pre-loaded data for:**
- ✅ **AAPL** - Apple Inc. (iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services, Wearables)
- ✅ **MSFT** - Microsoft (Productivity, Cloud, Personal Computing)
- ✅ **QCOM** - Qualcomm (QCT, QTL segments)
- ✅ **NVDA** - NVIDIA (Compute/Networking, Graphics)
- ✅ **TSLA** - Tesla (Automotive, Energy, Services)

**How to use Demo Mode:**

1. **Restart the app:**
   ```bash
   # Stop current app (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   # Then restart:
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Enter one of the demo tickers:** AAPL, MSFT, QCOM, NVDA, or TSLA

3. **Click Analyze** - It will use cached data instead of making API calls

4. **See the message:**
   ```
   ℹ️ Demo Mode: Using cached data for AAPL.
   For live data, please add credits to your API account.
   ```

## 🎁 Bonus: Adding More Demo Companies

Want to add your own demo data? Edit `demo_data.py`:

```python
DEMO_COMPANIES = {
    'YOUR_TICKER': {
        'name': 'Company Name',
        'segmented_revenues': [...],
        'income_statements': [...]
    }
}
```

Follow the same structure as existing companies (AAPL, MSFT, etc.).

**Summary:** Your API is out of credits, but I've added Demo Mode so you can still use the full app with AAPL, MSFT, QCOM, NVDA, and TSLA!

**Try it now:** Just restart the app and enter **QCOM** 🚀
